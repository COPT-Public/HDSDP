\section{Conclusions}

In this manuscript we propose an extension of the dual-scaling algorithm based on
the HSD embedding. The resultant solver, \text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}}, is presented to
demonstrate how dual method can be effectively integrated with the embedding
trick. \text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}} is developed in parallel to \text{{\ttfamily{DSDP5.8}}} and
is entailed with several newly added computational techniques. The solver
exhibits promising performance on several benchmark datasets and is under
active development. Users are welcome to try the solver and provide valuable suggestions.
