## HDSDP 

#### A Homogeneous Dual-scaling Interior Point Solver for Sparse Semi-definite Programming

HDSDP implements a dual-scaling interior point method for sparse Semi-definite programming problems (SDPs). The solver inherits several features from  **DSDP5.8** [1] and presents some new aspects for the dual-scaling algorithm. HDSDP is written in ANSI C and is maintained by Cardinal Operations COPT development team. More features are still under active development.

#### Solver overview

HDSDP solves standard-form semi-definite programs expressed by

$$\min_{\mathcal{A} \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{S}_+^n} \left\langle \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{X} \right\rangle  \\
  \\ 
$$

where we do linear optimization subject to affine constraints over the cone of positive-semidefinite matrices.
