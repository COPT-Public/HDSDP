  {{\texttt{HDSDP}}} is a numerical software solving the semidefinite programming problems. The main framework of {{\texttt{HDSDP}}} resembles the dual-scaling
  interior point solver {{\texttt{DSDP}}}{\cite{benson2008algorithm}} and several new
  features, including a dual method based on the simplified homogeneous self-dual embedding, have been implemented. The embedding technique enhances stability of the dual method 
  and several new heuristics and computational techniques are designed to accelerate its convergence. 
  HDSDP aims to show how dual-scaling algorithm benefits from the
  self-dual embedding and it is developed in parallel to {{{\texttt{DSDP5.8}}}}.
  Numerical experiments over several classical benchmark datasets exhibit its robustness and efficiency, and particularly its advantages on SDP instances featuring low-rank structure and sparsity. \revised{{\hdsdp} is open-sourced under MIT license and available at \href{https://github.com/COPT-Public/HDSDP}{https://github.com/COPT-Public/HDSDP}}.
