\section{Acknowledgement}

We thank Dr. Qi Huangfu and Dr. Joachim Dahl from \text{{\ttfamily{COPT}}} development team \citep{copt} for their valuable suggestions in the solver design and implementation. We also appreciate
Hans Mittelmann's efforts in benchmarking the solver. Finally, we sincerely
respect the developers of \text{{\ttfamily{DSDP}}} for their precious suggestions
{\cite{benson2008algorithm}} and their invaluable efforts getting
\text{{\ttfamily{DSDP}}} through all along the way. It is the efficient and elegant
implementation from \text{{\ttfamily{DSDP5.8}}} that guides \text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}} to
where it is.
