\section{Conclusions}

We propose an extension of the dual-scaling algorithm based on
the embedding technique. The resultant solver, \text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}}, is presented to
demonstrate how dual method can be effectively integrated with the embedding. 
\text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}} is developed in parallel to \text{{\ttfamily{DSDP5.8}}} and
is entailed with several newly added features, especially an advanced conic KKT solver. The solver
exhibits promising performance on several benchmark datasets and is under
active development. Users are welcome to try the solver and provide valuable suggestions.
