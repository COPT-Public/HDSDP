\section{Conclusions}

We propose an extension of the dual-scaling algorithm based on
the embedding technique. The resultant solver, \text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}}, is presented to
demonstrate how dual method can be effectively integrated with the embedding. 
\text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}} is developed in parallel to \text{{\ttfamily{DSDP5.8}}} and
is entailed with several newly added features, especially an advanced conic KKT solver. The solver
exhibits promising performance on several benchmark datasets and is under
active development. \revised{Now \text{{\ttfamily{HDSDP}}} works as one of the candidate SDP methods in the state-of-the-art commercial solver \texttt{COPT}}. Users are welcome to try the solver and provide valuable suggestions.
